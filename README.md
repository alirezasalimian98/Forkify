Forkify Project

this Project was the last project of the Javascript course by "Jonas Schmedtmann" that implment tons of features using pure javascript

features:

1. have access to a recipe API to search for food recipe
2. have ability to bookmark recipes and have them in the bookmarks saved in local storage
3. you can add your own recipe to the API and can see the difference with a icon beside the recipe

and bunch of other coding features you can checkout the codes and i tried to write the codes clean and readable as much as possible and
respect the architect that defined for this project.

Thanks for reading . Have fun :)
